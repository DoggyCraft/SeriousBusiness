The plugin for doing Serious Business on DoggyCraft.dk!

Background
---------
The goal is to provide as many business and financial mechanics as possible for players while still maintaining a "making sense" balance towards survival gameplay

*   Company registration
*   Company budgets
*	The Cryptocoin alt-currency "Nudes"
*	Stock trading

Installation
---------
*	[Install a Spigot server](https://github.com/DogOnFire/Werewolf/#obtain-a-build-of-spigot)
*	[Download Serious Business](https://github.com/DogOnFire/Werewolf/#download)
*	Drop the SeriousBusiness.jar into the plugins folder.
*	Start your Spigot/CraftBukkit server. (Using /reload can have unwanted side effects with players still online, and with complex plugins dependencies, so it's not recommended.)
