** Store items in a company chest. Instantly shared with rest of company.
* Work in Management
** Register Headquarters in land with lower company taxes
** Register Sales stores in land with lower sales taxes
** Register up to 3 other sub-companies
** Move money around to other companies to avoid taxes
** Hire people
** Fire people
** Rise to CEO
** Business-2-business contracts for import/export
** Get fined at contract breach
** Take loans in other companies
* A Cryptocoin alt-currency called "Nudes"
* Shady business practices such as money transferring
* Financial fines
* Trade company stock on the stock market
* Manipulate the state of other companies and harvest the result on the stock market
